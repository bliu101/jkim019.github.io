        We are an organization located in Medford, Massachusetts that is dedicated
        to the thriving of the recently domesticated species, the Syrian Hamster.
        In order to achieve this, we house big, healthy hamsters with big enclosures
        to thrive in. Through extensive breeding knowledge and research of our team,
        we are able to create a great line of thriving hamsters, where we keep the

        hamsters with the best genetics for the future, and give out the rest to families
        looking to adopt a furry little animal for their household.

        We specialize in one of 5 currently domesticated hamster species, the "Syrian Hamster".
        This is because we believe that the syrian hamster's bigger size allows us to get a better
        idea of health. The idea behind his philosophy is,
      </p>
      <p>
        <em> "The Bigger the Hamster, the Bigger the Heart."
          </em>
      </p>
      <p>
          For those looking for a different type of hamster (ie. the Dwarf Hamster Species), please locate a
          different business that breeds them. For those looking for a nice and fluffy syrian hamster, you are
          at the right place!
